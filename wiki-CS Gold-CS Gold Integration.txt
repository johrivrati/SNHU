## Overview: CS Gold Integration

CS Gold is the software system that is used for door lock security access based on housing assignments for students and staff locations for employees, meal plans and Penman cash.  This system at SNHU currently integrates with Colleague. SNHU requires that active UC student biodemographic information be sent to CS Gold.



The purpose of this recipe is to generate a flat file which could be consumed by CS Gold system by extracting data from relevant Ellucian Ethos Data models in Cosmos DB. The flat file generated needs to follow the file specifications mentioned in the tech spec docs which includes conditions like output file type, column headers, default values, etc.

## Recipe Details

### Current Process



CS Gold is the software system that is used for door lock security access based on housing assignments for students and staff locations for employees, meal plans and Penman cash.  



This system at SNHU currently integrates with Colleague. SNHU requires that active UC student biodemographic information be sent to CS Gold.



In the existing integration, there are three files which come from Colleague:



File used to create Staff Accounts


File used to create Door Access for Student


File used to create UC Commuter Student Accounts. 



For the future integration, the authoritative source of the data required will change. The following will be the authoritative source for each respective file



Workday


THD


Banner


### New Process



As authoritative sources, Workday and THD will publish change notifications for their respective Ethos Data Model data. 




As part of the SNHU's new Banner-CS Gold Integration,



###  



the student data required for the  integration with Banner will be facilitated by Cosmos and the SNHUniversal File Generator (SFG). The file generated by Lingk recipes would be used by CS Gold system to create UC Commuter Student Accounts.









 


## Prerequisites & Setup

### Data Models:



This integration uses the following Ellucian Ethos Data Models (EEDMs):



persons


Student academic programs


sites



### Filtering Criteria:








The persons records included in the file are filtered to only include active UC student data.



This is achieved by doing the following.



Get all the records from student-academic-programs with enrollment status active and site ID set to UC.


Next, generate a list of unique persons from the above list and use this to fetch the person details from persons model. We get the person id and roles.


Next, from the above list of unique persons ,filter out person records who have a student role with a roles.endOn date before the current date.


Now gather the person details from the list of persons generated in the above step and generate the output data and write it to a file.
